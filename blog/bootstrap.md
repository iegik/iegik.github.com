# Симбиоз Twitter Bootstrap и OOCSS

> Bootstrap is Twitter's toolkit for kickstarting CSS for websites, apps, and more. It includes base CSS styles for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, alerts, and more.

 * Built for and by nerds!
 * Responsive design!
 * Custom jQuery plugins
 * Cross-everything
 * 12-column grid
 * Growing library: front-end toolkit with dozens of components ready to be put to use.
 * For all skill levels
 * Styleguide docs
 * Built on LESS
 * HTML5

> Basically, a CSS “object” is a repeating visual pattern, which can be abstracted into an independent snippet of HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. Once created, an object can then be reused throughout a site.

Two Main Principles of OOCSS:

 * Separate structure and skin!
 * Separate container and content!
 * Cross-everything
 * debugging
 * non-depending
 * 7-column grid
 * Built on SASS
 * CSS3
